# Shopify-FAQ-Page-Implementation

Added a new FAQ page template and section to the Shopify theme. This includes a page.faq.json template for dynamic page selection and a faq.liquid section for structured FAQ content with categories and questions. Also updated styles and scripts as needed to ensure a seamless user experience.

HTML & CSS – For structuring and styling the FAQ page.
I used Javascript for expand more section.
Shopify Liquid – For creating dynamic templates (faq.liquid).
